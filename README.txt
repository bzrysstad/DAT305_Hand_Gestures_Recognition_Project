Step 1: Download the hand recognition data set (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog/data)

Step 2: Unzip the downloaded file and place the "leapGestRecog" folder in the same folder as the .py files.

Step 3: Run Hand_Gesture_Recognition_Project.py and select the program (has to be run in numbered order, or full program run the first time)

(NOTE: Sometimes the SVM model doesn't properly compute - the script just has to be re-run if so.)
